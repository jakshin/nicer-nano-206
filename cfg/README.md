## Configuration

This `nanorc` configures nano to act more like most people probably expect it to.   
It references this repo's [syntax definitions](../syntax), so they should be installed with it.   
To manually install both:

```sh
# Run this in the repo's root directory
ln -sv "$PWD/cfg/nanorc" ~/.nanorc
ln -sv "$PWD/syntax" ~/.nano-syntax
```
