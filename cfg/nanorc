# Configuration file for GNU nano v2.0.6 on macOS
# For details, see https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.0/nanorc.5.html
# or download https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.0/nano-2.0.6.tar.gz

# A few niceties, including "smooth" scrolling (line-by-line),
# the ability to suspend nano with Ctrl+Z, and sane default tab stops
set morespace
set smarthome
set smooth
set suspend
set tabsize 4

# Automatic indentation is handy when writing/editing indented files like code,
# but super-annoying when pasting code into nano v2.0.6, so default it off (Alt+I toggles it)
unset autoindent

# Default to indenting with hard tabs -- needed for nano206++.sh to work correctly,
# as it can pass the `--tabstospaces` option to nano to make it indent with spaces,
# but there's no option to make nano indent with tabs if it's configured here to use spaces
#
# Toggle between indenting with tabs/spaces while nano is running with Alt+Q;
# put this in ~/.bashrc and/or ~/.zshrc to make nano206++.sh default to indenting with spaces:
# export NICER_NANO_PREFER_SPACES=true
unset tabstospaces
