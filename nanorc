# Configuration file for GNU nano v2.0.6 on macOS
# For details, see https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.0/nanorc.5.html
# or download https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.0/nano-2.0.6.tar.gz

# A few niceties, including "smooth" scrolling (line-by-line),
# the ability to suspend nano with Ctrl+Z, and sane default tab stops
set morespace
set smarthome
set smooth
set suspend
set tabsize 4

# Automatic indentation is handy when writing/editing indented files like code,
# but super-annoying when pasting code into nano v2.0.6, so default it off (Alt+I toggles it)
unset autoindent

# Default this off, so nano-smart-indent.sh can pass `--tabstospaces` as needed,
# as nano has no command-line parameter to turn it off, if it's enabled here (Alt+Q toggles it)
#
# NOTE: Enabling tabstospaces here breaks nano-smart-indent.sh's logic,
# but to prefer spaces whenever detecting the indentation of existing files is inconclusive,
# `export NANO_SMART_INDENT_PREFER_SPACES=true` in ~/.bashrc and/or ~/.zshrc
unset tabstospaces
