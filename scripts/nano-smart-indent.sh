# This is a wrapper script for nano, which passes its arguments to nano, after first trying to
# figure out the best indentation settings for the file(s) being edited, and passing additional
# options to nano to adjust its indentation behavior as needed. The most convenient way to use
# it is through an alias: alias nano=/path/to/nano-smart-indent.sh
#
# FIXME ^ but an alias won't work when other programs launch nano, e.g. git
# so maybe either also set $EDITOR / $VISUAL if they mention nano,
# or use a symlink in /usr/local/bin instead (refusing to replace anything already there)
#
# It first tries to use EditorConfig settings, as reported by the editorconfig CLI. This works
# on both existing and new files, since finding a relevant .editorconfig file only depends on
# the edited file's path. If the editorconfig CLI isn't installed, this step is skipped; if it
# is installed but you don't want this script to use it, put this in your .bashrc and/or .zshrc:
# export NANO_SMART_INDENT_NO_EDITORCONFIG=true
#
# If EditorConfig settings aren't found (or aren't used), the script next tries to read up to
# 20 KB from the file, and detect its indentation style. This, of course, only works on files
# that already exist.
#
# For all of this to work, neither /etc/nanorc nor ~/.nanorc can contain "set tabstospaces";
# that's because nano doesn't provide a command-line option which tells it to use tabs for
# indentation, so if you've told it to use spaces for indentation in one of its config files,
# this script has no way to change that setting. And _that_, in turn, means that if this script
# can't detect a file's indentation style, nano's default setting of using tabs for indentation
# will come into play. If you're more a spaces-for-indentation kind of person, put this into
# your .bashrc and/or .zshrc to tell this script to default to having nano indent with spaces
# when it can't figure out what else to do: export NANO_SMART_INDENT_PREFER_SPACES=true
#
# You can always pass --tabstospaces (or -E) if you want to indent a given file with spaces,
# and this script will dutifully pass that setting along to nano, regardless of what EditorConfig
# thinks or the contents already in the file. You can also pass --tabs, which isn't an actual
# nano option, but which this script takes as the opposite of --tabstospaces, and which will
# make it _not_ tell nano to indent with spaces, regardless of EditorConfig's opinion, etc.
# If you pass both --tabstospaces and --tabs, --tabstospaces always wins, regardless of order.
#
# The --tabsize (or -T) option is also passed through, setting the tab display width when
# indenting with tabs, or the number of spaces to use when indenting with spaces. If you don't
# pass it, either the relevant EditorConfig setting or the existing indentation width in the file
# will be used, or -- if neither of those are applicable/available -- the `tabsize` setting from
# nano's config files, or its compiled-in default of 8.
